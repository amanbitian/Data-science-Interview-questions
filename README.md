2) How would you detect concept drift? 

3) What are some ways to speed up your LLM?

4) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the star and snowflake schemas?

5) How would you interpret the coefficient of a logistic regression?

6) How would you interpret the coefficient of a Cox-PH model?

7) When would you use survival analysis over logistic regression?

8) What are interaction variables and how would you interpret them?

9) You have a sample size below 30. What test would you ideally use to test for correlation?

10) What are the assumptions of OLS?

11) What are the assumptions of ANOVA?

12) Does prompt length matter and how if so?

13) Does positioning within a prompt matter and how if so?

16) What is Missing Not at Random? Can you describe the two other related missingness mechanisms?

17) What are the ramifications of single v multiple imputation when statistical inference is involved?

18) You want to know the top variable to take action on in real life. Can you rely on the variable importances output by RandomForest? Justify your answer.

19) You want to implement a bundling/cross-sell strategy. After implementing an association rules algorithm, what would you check for and how? 

20) You're not sure if you should rely on your confusion matrix because you suspect the sample size is too small. Without increasing your sample size, what should you do? Hint: what test would you use and how would you use it?

21) What is the twin towers architecture in recommendation engines? 

22) What are some metrics for evaluating recommendation engines?
